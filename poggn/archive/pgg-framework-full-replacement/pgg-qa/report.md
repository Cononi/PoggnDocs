## QA Matrix

| Area | Pass/Fail | Evidence |
|---|---:|---|
| Source of Truth | PASS | `packages/core/src/skill-framework/registry.ts` is source of truth; registry validation errors `[]`; docs generator 2회 `unchanged`. |
| Skill Framework | PASS | Required core flows are `pgg-add`, `pgg-plan`, `pgg-code`, `pgg-refactor`, `pgg-performance`, `pgg-qa`; common required fields are rendered. |
| Legacy Replacement | PASS | New imports route through `./skill-framework/index.js`; `workflow-contract.ts` remains deprecated compatibility layer. |
| Public API / CLI Compatibility | PASS | `packages/core/src/index.ts` exports new registry/types/contracts; CLI update ran from `packages/cli/dist/index.js`. |
| Korean Generated Docs | PASS | Korean headings and completion contracts found in generated `.codex/skills/pgg-*.md`. |
| POGGN Workspace | PASS | All process artifacts are under `poggn/active/pgg-framework-full-replacement`; archive destination did not exist before PASS. |
| Versioning | PASS | `currentVersion 3.2.0`, `targetVersion 4.0.0`, `bumpType major`, `convention feat`, ledger source recorded; `pnpm verify:version-history` PASS. |
| Git Mode / Branch Lifecycle | PASS | `pggGit on`, git repo true, working branch `ai/feat/4.0.0-framework-replacement`, release branch `release/4.0.0-framework-replacement`, remote `origin` configured. |
| Commit Message Convention | PASS | Current PGG commits use `{convention}. {version} {message}`: `feat. 4.0.0 ...`, `refactor. 4.0.0 ...`. |
| Completion Message Contract | PASS | Generated docs include exact `다음 flow를 실행하세요: <next-flow-id>` contract and per-flow final sentence routing. |
| Token Accounting | PASS | `metrics/token-usage.jsonl` exists and schema check passed for 47 records before QA records. |
| pgg-add | PASS | Requirements, Acceptance Criteria, topic_name, active workspace, version decision, assumptions, token records exist. |
| pgg-plan | PASS | Plan, task breakdown, specs, reviews, version bump task, verification strategy, pgg-performance decision exist. |
| pgg-code | PASS | Task results, verify evidence, reviews, version policy, token records, no push, clean verify evidence exist. |
| pgg-code Task Commits | PASS | `45700b0`, `3154cb0`, `46d012a`, `c3f3578` recorded with governed messages. |
| pgg-refactor | PASS | Before/after comparison PASS, diff inspection PASS, behavior-preserving refactor commits `eb79669`, `50ef248`. |
| pgg-performance | PASS | Performance criteria were not required; no unmeasured performance improvement was claimed. |
| pgg-qa | PASS | This report exists under `pgg-qa/report.md` and compatibility copy under `qa/report.md` for archive tooling. |
| Generated Docs | PASS | generator 2회 `unchanged`; generated Markdown was not patched directly during QA. |
| Technical Checks | PASS | `pnpm build`, `build:readme`, `build:dashboard`, `test`, `test:core`, `test:dashboard`, `verify:version-history` PASS. |
| Archive / Release / Push | PASS | Precondition PASS; final archive/release/push result is recorded after PASS procedure in archived report. |

## Archive / Release / Push Result

- QA report status before archive: `done`
- archive destination precheck: not existing
- archive move: PASS, `poggn/active/pgg-framework-full-replacement` -> `poggn/archive/pgg-framework-full-replacement`
- version record: PASS, `version.json` targetVersion `4.0.0`, previousVersion `3.2.0`
- version ledger: PASS, `poggn/version-history.ndjson` appended `4.0.0`
- final QA/archive commit: pending
- release branch: pending
- push: pending

## 남은 위험

- dashboard build has a Vite chunk-size warning for `dist/assets/index-*.js`; it is not a failing criterion for this migration.

## 남은 불확실성

- remote push depends on SSH/network availability at release time.

## 최종 판정

PASS
